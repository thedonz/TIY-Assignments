 * that into its string representatation in English words. For
 * example, "1234.56" to "one thousand two hundred thirty four
 * and 56/100", just like you would see on a check.
 *
 * In a lot of ways, this is the inverse of the "String Calculator"
 * problem, so a lot of what you've learned will be put into
 * practice here, but backwards. Hooray!
