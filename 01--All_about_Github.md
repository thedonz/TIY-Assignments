My family enjoys scuba-diving and nearly every school vacation we go on a diving trip. We have noticed that there are three completely different kinds of divers. We call them the "nature lovers", the "pool guys", and the "seals". The people whom we call "nature lovers" enjoy getting in the water for a short swim to look at the rocks, seaweed, and underwater creatures which are swimming around. The "pool guys", who wear the latest hi-tech equipment, come for a short while to have a swim and test how good their equipment is. The "seals", who wear only their swimsuits, dive in the water and disappear for what seem like hours. Each of the divers enjoy the ocean in different ways.

The "nature lovers" are the ones who enjoy snorkeling around for brief periods of time. They always try to have a minimal impact on the environment; they always take out the garbage, for example. They would never take rocks or shells. They are there to see, but not spoil the beauty of nature under water.

The "pool guys" are the divers who want to go to the beach or ocean without ever actually leaving their backyard. They come in sport utility vehicles (SUVs) carrying heavy-duty wet suits, and the latest in diving masks, fins, and air tanks.

They are the ones who are so covered with equipment they can hardly see, feel, or touch the underwater environment. Comparing air tanks and wet suits are what they do most.

The "seals" are the divers who act as if they are returning back to their natural habitat. Perhaps in a "previous life" they were actually seals and when diving into the water, they hardly make a splash. Once underwater, they start poking around looking for crabs, abalone and other fish. The "seals" are the people who enjoy cooking on the beach. They are also the ones, who leave the biggest mess. However, since they use beach wood for their fires and eat what they catch in the ocean, there is no paper or plastic packaging left behind.

My family is a combination of all three types. All my brother wants to do is try out different kinds of equipment and see how deep he can dive. As for my father, he is a "seal": swimming around and cooking his 'catch' is what he enjoys most. My mother and I are "nature lovers": swimming with snorkels and fins is fun, but neither of us have any interest in diving fifty feet down or reaching under a rock to find a slimy abalone. We all enjoy our diving trips in our own way.
